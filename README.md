# AutomaticModulationClassification

In it's current state, this repository doesn't represent a proper project. It consists of miscellaneous code I used to put together my senior project. The code targets at least three different systems (Jetson, Linux x86 with GPU, Windows x86), but isn't organized that way. Most code is data dependent and needs to be generated by a real radio system or with GNU Radio. 

I have plans to extend this and will probably start from scratch in a new repository.
